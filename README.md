# Analyzing APT X and USBFerry Malware

## Objective
This project focuses on analyzing the activities of APT X, a notorious advanced persistent threat (APT) group, with a particular emphasis on the USBFerry malware. APT X has been actively targeting air-gapped networks in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, primarily within military, government, and high-tech sectors. The goal is to identify the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT X, assess their impact, and propose strategies for mitigating these threats.

## Skills Learned
- **Threat Intelligence Analysis**: Mastered the identification and analysis of APTs, focusing on understanding the complex attack chains of APT X.
- **Incident Response**: Gained insights into responding to sophisticated malware attacks, especially in environments that are considered highly secure, such as air-gapped networks.
- **Network Security**: Developed strategies for protecting sensitive networks from malware that uses unconventional vectors, such as USB devices.

## Tools Used
- **OpenCTI Platform**: Utilized for gathering and visualizing threat intelligence data related to APT X and its malware, USBFerry.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**: Mapped out the attack patterns and techniques associated with APT X, enabling a comprehensive understanding of their strategies.
- **Trend Micro Research**: Leveraged detailed reports to gain deeper insights into the tactics and evolution of the USBFerry malware used by APT X.

## Steps

### 1. Threat Overview
APT X, identified as an advanced persistent threat, has been actively involved in cyber espionage since 2011. Their activities are primarily aimed at government, military, healthcare, and high-tech industries. APT X employs sophisticated strategies, such as spear-phishing emails and weaponized attachments, to gain initial access.

### 2. USBFerry Malware Analysis
The USBFerry malware, used by APT X, targets air-gapped networks by exploiting USB storage devices. This malware is known for its stealth and ability to execute commands, exfiltrate data, and maintain persistence within isolated environments. It uses a fake executable decoy and a USB trojan strategy to carry out these tasks.

### 3. Attack Techniques
APT X utilizes a range of techniques as part of its TTPs. The MITRE ATT&CK framework helps in categorizing these techniques, which include:
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails.
- **Execution**: USB-based malware execution.
- **Persistence**: Using tools like BITSAdmin to maintain access.
- **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscating the malware’s presence on the network.

### 4. Mitigation Strategies
To defend against APT X and similar threats, organizations should:
- **Strengthen Network Segmentation**: Implement stricter controls on air-gapped networks to prevent unauthorized USB access.
- **Enhance User Training**: Educate employees about phishing and other social engineering tactics.
- **Deploy Advanced Threat Detection**: Use tools like OpenCTI and the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator to identify and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

## Conclusion
APT X represents a significant threat to sensitive industries due to its sophisticated methods and the use of the USBFerry malware. By understanding and mapping out their TTPs, organizations can better protect their assets against such advanced threats.
